<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I need my paddles! You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers? YOU BETTER RUN! She's our friend, and she's crazy! I need my paddles! It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says more. </p>

  <p>Oh... candy, leftovers, Eggo's... she really likes Eggo's. If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right? Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one? Don’t take it so personally, okay? I don’t like most people. He’s in the vast majority. </p>
  
 
  <p>Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. Mistakes have been made. This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone. Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. </p>
